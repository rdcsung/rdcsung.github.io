After I installed my new laptop, I continued to study my Udacity deep learning
[course ](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud730) assignment 3.

It is about deep neural network.
The technology of regularization, drop-out are implemented in the assignment.

## Normal logistic classification with regularization

The image size is 28 * 28 = 784.
Learning steps 20001

Batch size 128
