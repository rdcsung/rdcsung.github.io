After I installed my new laptop, I continued to study my Udacity deep learning
[course ](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud730) assignment 3.

The code is based on [original](https://github.com/Arn-O/udacity-deep-learning)
with [modification](https://github.com/rdcsung/udacity-deep-learning)

It is about deep neural network.
The technology of regularization, drop-out are implemented in the assignment.

## Normal logistic classification with regularization

The image size is 28 * 28 = 784.
Learning steps 20001.
I have tried different batch size, it looks like 128 is a good batch size.

Batch size 128

Batch size 64

Batch size 32

Batch size 16

## Find best regularization
With batch size 128
I tried different regularization parameter.
1e-4, 1e-3.9, 1e-3.8,.....   1e-2
